    <p> My name is Paul Sobers. I am 20 years old and my birthday is October 23 1998. I was born in Georgetown Guyana. I found my passion in Computer Science in 10th garde when 3 software developers came together to teach my class the basic. Ever since then I fell inlove with coding. Something I feel strongly about is the ability to keep an open mind and perspective to different views and opinions. Im very weird and different but I have a strong work ethic.</p>
