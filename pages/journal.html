    <h2>My Pathway From Here...</h2>
    <main>
      <p> I’m 20 years old and after graduating high school, I didn’t start my first year of college because of FAFSA problems. I worked financially to get myself to Medgar Evers college and once I got there and took my first CS class, I realized I was going to be paying too much for classes that I wasn’t getting enough out of. I joined Marcy Lab School this year because I love computer science and figuring out problems. I love knowing how things work and the why behind them. My mom is my motivation, and she will tell you that I never have liked school. I love Marcy Lab. I love that every day I am naturally and quickly learning. Im not just doing tasks I’m told, but figuring out how to solve problems. The tasks and assignments are long and hard but really fun- I love to be challenged and Reuben pushes us to teach ourselves when we don’t know something everyday. After just 4 weeks in the program, I’ve already built a website for a client. Learning and coding isn’t all that we’re learning or focus on. I also love that we take time to reflect and work on ourselves. Working on myself is something new that I’ve never seen before. In coaching conversations with Maya, I’ve learned about my values, talked about my family, and how to plan my time more efficiently. We practice public speaking and how to lead in a way that feels good for me. I also love the daily stand up and close out routines we do because it can take the pressure of the day. We are all working so hard that the 10-15 minutes we have fun goes a long way. Every one of the fellows is like family already- when one has a problem we all try to figure it out and whoever is closest to you will come help.</p>
